## 🎮 About

My nostalgic journey into reverse engineering AirStrike 3D - the first PC game that captured my imagination as a kid. This repository contains tools and research for understanding the game's internals.

## 🔧 Tools

### APK Archive Extraction

```bash
# Extract game assets from encrypted .apk archives
python extract_apk.py pak0.apk        # Extracts all files
python pack_apk.py extracted_dir/ new.apk  # Repack modified assets
```

### mdl to obj and vice versa

```bash
python mdl_obj_converter.py some_file.mdl
python mdl_obj_converter.py some_file.obj
```

### Save previewer (+imhex struct preview)

```bash
python decrypt_save.py decrypt game.bin -o decrypted.bin
```

### Audio Conversion

```bash
# Convert MO3 tracker modules to standard audio
sudo dnf install libopenmpt openmpt123
openmpt123 --render file.mo3 --output file.wav
```

### Graphics Viewing

```bash
# Best TGA texture viewer for Linux
# https://github.com/bluescan/tacentview
tacentview texture.tga
```

## 🐧 Linux Compatibility

### Running via Steam Proton (Fedora + AMD GPU)

```bash
# Fix OpenGL extension issues for old games
MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2003 %command%
```

Add this to the game's launch options in Steam.

## 📋 Technical Notes

- **Archive Format:** Custom encrypted APK containers (not Android APK)
- **Executable:** ASProtect v1.0 packed (detected via YARA rules)
- **Assets:** TGA textures, MDL 3D models, MO3 audio modules
- **Encryption:** XOR cipher with 1024-byte key table

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Extract game assets: `python extract_pak.py /path/to/pak0.apk`
3. Browse extracted files in the created directory
4. Convert audio files as needed

### build

1. download llvm-mingw from <https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases>:
- `llvm-mingw-YYYYMMDD-ucrt-ubuntu-20.04-x86_64.tar.xz` for win10+ (ucrt)
- `llvm-mingw-YYYYMMDD-msvcrt-ubuntu-20.04-x86_64.tar.xz` for win7+ (legacy crt)

2. extract to repository root in dir `llvm-mingw`

3. Run
```bash
cmake --preset llvm-mingw-i686
cmake --build --preset llvm-mingw-i686
```

> **note**: preset uses `jobs=1` due to lld linker deadlock on parallel linking in mingw context

## 🏴‍☠️ Ghidra Project

🔒 Since the project uses **ASProtect 1.0**, I decided on Linux using a simple debugger to just walk until we get some kind of loop. The game seems to unpack itself creating some thread, so even the debugger detaches at some moment in `ntdll` magic 🪄, so we need just to pause at any moment and get the address of the desired function (loop).

🎯 The next step is using **x64dbg** with **DumpEx** plugin—dump with the address of main loop function. And that's all!

📊 **Stats:**

- 📦 Game weights: **31.2 MB**
- 🔍 In Ghidra project I've marked some of the interesting places:
  - 🎮 Loading models
  - 💾 Working with saves
  - 🔧 Core game mechanics

🚀 **Usage:**

> Just clone and open with Ghidra—the project is ready to explore yourself!

Maybe some time someone will reverse it completely 😏 🦀⚡
